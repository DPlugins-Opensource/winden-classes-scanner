## Scaning Instructions 

If you want to scan entire theme folder: 

```themes/YOURTHEME/```

If you want to scan specific theme folder with subfolders for example /src/: 

```themes/YOURTHEME/src/```

Same is for plugins

```plugins/YOURPLUGINS/```
or ```plugins/YOURPLUGINS/src/```


Plugin will scan all files without restrictions of file types
